                          or malignant (cancerous), and both types can pose significant risks depending on their size, growth rate, and location. 
                          Brain tumors disrupt normal brain functions by compressing, invading, or displacing healthy brain tissue, leading 
                          to symptoms such as persistent headaches ü§ï, seizures, nausea ü§¢, difficulty with speech üó£Ô∏è or vision üëÄ, and even 
                          behavioral changes.
                          Diagnostic techniques have advanced significantly, with MRI, CT scans, and PET scans üñ•Ô∏è providing clear images of brain 
                          structures. In addition, biopsies help doctors examine tumor cells under a microscope üî¨, enabling precise diagnosis. 
                          Scientists are also exploring blood-based biomarkers to detect brain tumors early and non-invasively, a promising 
                          development that could revolutionize brain tumor screening. The journey of diagnosis is complex but crucial, as 
                          early detection can improve treatment options and outcomes. üí™"""

                          based on the tumor's size, location, and growth speed. For instance, a tumor in the frontal lobe can affect personality 
                          and decision-making ü§î, while a tumor in the occipital lobe can lead to visual disturbances üëÅÔ∏è. As tumors grow, they

                          location of the tumor makes surgical removal challenging and sometimes risky.
                          Treatment plans are often complex, involving a combination of surgery üî™, radiation therapy üåê, and chemotherapy üíä. 
                          Each case requires a personalized approach, as treatment goals vary: some aim to remove the tumor entirely, while others
